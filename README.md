# PhonePe-Case-Study
This project was completed as part of the Coding Ninjas Data Analytics Bootcamp. It involves end-to-end analysis of the PhonePe datasets to uncover trends and insights related to digital payments across Indian states and districts.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas) <br>
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn <br>
Data Preprocessing: scikit-learn (for normalization and scaling) <br>
Presentation: PowerPoint <br>
IDE: Jupyter Notebook <br>

# Data Sources
Multiple CSV files from the PhonePe dataset, including: <br>
State_Txn and Users <br>
State_TxnSplit <br>
State_DeviceData <br>
District_Txn and Users <br>
District Demographics <br>

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Combined multiple datasets using .concat() <br>
Filled missing values with appropriate substitutes (0 or 'Unknown') <br>
Ensured integrity for merging operations <br>

# Key Insights & Analysis
Total number of states and districts <br>
Top & bottom states by transaction volume and amount <br>
Most used transaction types per state per quarter <br>
Device brand distribution and its usage ratio across states <br>
Population-to-user ratio by state <br>
Correlation analysis (e.g., population density vs transaction volume) <br>
Normalized transaction trends over time <br>

# Visualizations
Generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn: <br>
Bar charts, pie charts, and stacked horizontal bar graphs <br>
Scatter plots to analyze correlation <br>
Line plots for normalized trends over time <br>

# Outcome
The analysis helps understand: <br>
Population centers driving digital adoption <br>
User behavior trends by device and transaction type <br>
Factors that can influence policy, marketing, or digital infrastructure <br>

# Final Output
The insights were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation for storytelling and reporting purposes.

# How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook (PhonePe.ipynb) to explore the data cleaning process. <br>
Use the PowerPoint presentation for a ready-made summary of findings. <br>
