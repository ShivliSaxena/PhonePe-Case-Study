# PhonePe-Case-Study
Case Study
This project was completed as part of the Coding Ninjas Data Analytics Bootcamp. It involves end-to-end analysis of the PhonePe datasets to uncover trends and insights related to digital payments across Indian states and districts.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Preprocessing: scikit-learn (for normalization and scaling)
Presentation: PowerPoint
IDE: Jupyter Notebook

# Data Sources
Multiple CSV files from the PhonePe dataset, including:
State_Txn and Users
State_TxnSplit
State_DeviceData
District_Txn and Users
District Demographics

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Combined multiple datasets using .concat()
Filled missing values with appropriate substitutes (0 or 'Unknown')
Ensured integrity for merging operations

# Key Insights & Analysis
Total number of states and districts
Top & bottom states by transaction volume and amount
Most used transaction types per state per quarter
Device brand distribution and its usage ratio across states
Population-to-user ratio by state
Correlation analysis (e.g., population density vs transaction volume)
Normalized transaction trends over time

# Visualizations
Generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Bar charts, pie charts, and stacked horizontal bar graphs
Scatter plots to analyze correlation
Line plots for normalized trends over time

# Outcome
The analysis helps understand:
Population centers driving digital adoption
User behavior trends by device and transaction type
Factors that can influence policy, marketing, or digital infrastructure

# Final Output
The insights were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation for storytelling and reporting purposes.

# How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook (PhonePe.ipynb) to explore the data cleaning process.
Use the PowerPoint presentation for a ready-made summary of findings.
